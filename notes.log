PROBLEM:
these drives are not reliable

SOLUTION:
- write to local drive





STOPPPPPP IT

If you were really going to train, you'd want real photos




WHY AM I KEEPING THESE THINGS????????




NEW PLAN
- fix my gap of photos on ai backup 2
- add a readme with instructions for when I stopped
    - Stopped backup on 2024-02-02
- put drives in ziplock back

- Then just put them in a local dir
- I'll be able to go 15 years before it filles up
